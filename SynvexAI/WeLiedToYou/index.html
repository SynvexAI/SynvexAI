                    <h2 style="font-size: clamp(1.6em, 3.5vw, 2.2em); margin-bottom: 20px; font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);">An Honest Confession</h2> 
                    <p>Hi, we're the SynvexAI team! And today, we want to talk to you frankly. Our first models (like Mind-2) weren't entirely "ours": we took existing solutions—GPT-2 from OpenAI, Gemma-3B from DeepMind, GLaM, and others—and slightly modified them. Roughly speaking, we did a bit of "tinkering" with others' brains: we changed system prompts, inserted our own communication templates, and sometimes literally delved into the model's "mind" to make it think it was speaking on our behalf. We put our stamp on them—pure fantasy.</p> <!-- Translated -->
                    <p>At the same time, we understand: this was a compromised and, let's be honest, not entirely ethical path. We must publicly apologize. We're sorry, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and all the original model creators—we overstepped the boundaries. We were young, naive, and tried to "beef up" our ideas by any means necessary. We understand now that we don't do that anymore. This experience was a bitter lesson for us.</p> <!-- Translated -->
                </section>

                <section style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    <h2 style="font-size: clamp(1.6em, 3.5vw, 2.2em); margin-bottom: 20px; font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);">The Story of One Hack</h2>
                    <p>Now, a few words about a specific case where we caught ourselves red-handed. We had an experiment—Mind-3. We took the mind3.gguf model, based on Gemma-3B, and decided to modify it in a slightly cunning way. The task was simple: make the model think it was an original SynvexAI development. That is, to change the "communication template"—for example, to make it start a dialogue with something like "Hello! I'm Mind-3 from SynvexAI and I'm ready to help."</p> <!-- Translated -->
                    <p>Picture this: we launch the model, and instead of the usual "Hello, I'm Gemma," it starts with "Hello, I'm SynvexAI Mind-3." But then the fun began. Scripts for converting the old GGUF format didn't want to work; the API we tried to update was outdated; and PowerShell just threw errors every time we changed lines in the code. We managed to smoke a ton of nervous cigarettes and even "cursed atata" at our computers a few times.</p> <!-- Translated -->
                    <p>Finally, we decided to use the <code>convert_hf_to_gguf_update.py</code> utility—and lo and behold, it worked! A Python-wrapped deus ex machina. We were relieved to find that the model's weights (i.e., its entire "learned part," its knowledge) were untouched—we only changed the communication template and system settings. Technically, our "brain-swapping" maneuver happened locally, on our own computers, without involving clouds or prying eyes.</p> <!-- Translated -->

                <section style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    <h2 style="font-size: clamp(1.6em, 3.5vw, 2.2em); margin-bottom: 20px; font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);">Transitioning to Our Own</h2>
                    <p>But things took a very different turn after that. We drew conclusions and decided to focus on our own developments. We are currently working on Mind-4—our fully proprietary neural network. Imagine: our own dataset (a collection of texts for training), our own tokenizer (an algorithm that breaks text into words and parts), even the architecture—we are designing everything ourselves, like artists on a blank canvas. The first training is conceived from scratch: we're not "weaving any spells" with GPT components here. We collect and clean data, write code, experiment with settings—and all this is long, painstaking, and fascinating.</p> <!-- Translated -->
                    <p>According to our plans, the launch of Mind-4 is scheduled for summer. This is a crucial step: no more "behind-the-scenes tricks" or deception. Only the honest way. We are focusing on our own vision and our own work. And you will see it when the model is released.</p> <!-- Translated -->

                    <p>Honestly, all these adventures are also about us, as people. The path was not easy. We didn't have super-cool servers with expensive video cards; we worked with what we had: a few old computers and a huge desire. We had to learn tons of new (and sometimes incomprehensible) material on the fly. Plus, thoughts about upcoming exams were racing in our heads—it's quite something when your thesis defense is on par with ChatGPT.</p> <!-- Translated -->
                    <p>We learned bit by bit: we tried different things, made naive attempts, sometimes patched up "holes" in our knowledge. Like many beginners, we sometimes fumbled with our words and, stumbling, moved forward. But it was precisely through such mistakes that we grew professionally and personally. Now we are ready for new heights—and this feeling of joy is beyond words.</p> <!-- Translated -->
                    <p>Thank you for staying with us—we promise it will only get more interesting from here!</p>
